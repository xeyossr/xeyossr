# Hey bro! ðŸ‘‹
**I'm xeyossr**, I'm a junior developer and I'm studying computer engineering. My hobbies are reading books, listening to music, customizing my linux desktop and programming. Some of my projects are private (for example, applications I use daily, etc.) and some of them I publish on github (very rarely :)). My goal is to get better at programming. By the way, I use Arch :)
